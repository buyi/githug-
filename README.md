git stash
```
当前工作区内容已被修改，但是并未完成。这时Boss来了，说前面的分支上面有一个Bug，需要立即修复。可是我又不想提交目前的修改，因为修改没有完成。但是，不提交的话，又没有办法checkout到前面的分支。此时用Git Stash就相当于备份工作区了。然后在Checkout过去修改，就能够达到保存当前工作区，并及时恢复的作用。
Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
相当于保存当时暂存区和工作目录，想回到纯净的工作目录。
